# platform_start
First attempt at making a game!

This is a practice application (including source) for learning how to make a 2d platformer. This does *not* include sprite creation.

## to run
1. double click platform_start.exe
2. alternatively if you own game maker studio, open the project (.gmx) and run from there

Achievements:
* create sprite/player objects
* create wall/ground objects
* add collision between player and ground
* state machines
* sprite changing for different states

Had working, but are no longer due to adding state machines:
* jumping
* death
* shooting bullets
